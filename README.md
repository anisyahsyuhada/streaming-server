Streaming Server
================

### What?

Go implementation of [https://github.com/juanvallejo/streaming-server](https://github.com/juanvallejo/streaming-server), which is currently written in `javascript` using `Node.js`.

Streaming server that serves media files to multiple clients, and keeps them all in sync using WebSockets.

### Why?

Thought it'd be fun.

### TODO

- Finish adding websocket support
- Add go dependency management
  - https://github.com/googollee/go-socket.io
